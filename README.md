# Comfy Brush Strokes

A ComfyUI node that applies painterly/brush-stroke effects to images, using either **ImageMagick (Wand)**, **PIL**, or **OpenCV** under the hood.

Note - ImageMagick is required to be installed and in your path in order for the Wand Python bindings to function! https://imagemagick.org/

**This is a work in progress, settings are preliminary at best**

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/justin-vt/ComfyUI-brushstrokes.git
```
